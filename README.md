# HNI-management-for-bank
A system which - 
Detects a high net worth individual(or multiple HNI) through cctv camera feed when they enter the branch.
Immediately sends out alert to branch head(through internal system alert, sms or by any other means).
Put a track on the person/people of interest and render it on the screen so that the branch head may easily see the precise location of the high net worth customer/s and arrange for the immediate service with minimum waiting time.
2. 	A mobile app which imitates the syndicate bank mobile banking app by which
 a customer can inform in advance about his/her arrival and purpose 
(generating an alert in the central system). Also, if a high net worth individual 
signs in to his account, this will generate an alert in the central system that 
can be seen by the bank head. This feature can later be integrated in the 
official Syndicate bank mobile app.
3. 	A web portal which imitates a net banking system in which users can login 
using their credentials and if a high net worth individual logs on to his 
account, it will generate the alert to the central system. This feature can be 
later integrated to the official Syndicate net banking system.
